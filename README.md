# EcommerceNodeApp

Working very well locally. But when deployed on heroku, Chrome kept sending requests for favicon.ico which is not even asked anywhere in my code. I tried various solutions mentioned but none of them work.
If you can pls clone it locally and run on localhost, it will work fine.
Also, you may need to install various dependencies first.
Thank you.
